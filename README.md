In this project I chose three transformers (BERT,RoBERTa,Naive Bayes). The dataset I used
is from KAGGLE (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) and I followed the instructions you see below.
Step 1a: Data collection (or selection of an existing dataset)
Step 1b: Explore data (understanding characteristics)
Step 2: Model selection
Step 3a: Data preparation (tokenization, vectorization, etc.)
Step 3b: Separation of data into training data and test data (training set, test set)
Step 4a: Model training
Step 4b: Adjustment-tuning of model parameters
Step 5: Model evaluation (selection of metrics e.g. accuracy, recall, confusion matrix etc.)
