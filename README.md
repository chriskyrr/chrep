# Transformers
In this project I applied three transformers (BERT,RoBERTa,Naive Bayes) on a dataset I found
from KAGGLE (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). The code follows these rules.
1.Data preparation (tokenization, vectorization, etc.)
2.Separation of data into training data and test data (training set, test set)
3.Model training
4.Adjustment-tuning of model parameters
5.Model evaluation (selection of metrics e.g. accuracy, recall, confusion matrix etc.)
